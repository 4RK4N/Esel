# Esel

1. Install the patched Eversense app and use it as described by the vendor
4. Build https://github.com/BernhardRo/Esel and install it on your phone.
5. Configuration:
  * Allow ESEL to run in the background (it will ask for it)
  * Don't touch the "DB Path" setting unless you changed the default data path when installing the Eversense app and know what you are doing!
  * Upload to Nightscout: Activate "Send to NightScout" in the preferences. It needs a configured AndroidAPS with internal NSClient or NSClient itself installed on the same phone
  * Inter-App-Broadcasts: Activate "Send to AAPS and xDrip". In xDrip and/or AndroidAPS activate the input method "640g/Eversense".
  * As this app is very experimental, please contact @AdrianLxM for positive/negative feedback and to register for future updates.
